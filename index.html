    <h1>For My Beloved</h1>
    <div class="heart"></div>
    <p>You bring colors to my world, and your love fills my heart with joy.</p>
    <p1>My Aditi, ever since you entered my life, it has been filled with a new sense of joy. Every moment spent with you carries a unique sweetness. Your smile brightens my face and your laughter brings peace to my soul. You are a dream that has turned into reality.

Every moment shared with you fills me with love and happiness. Your presence brings such comfort to my heart that I forget about everything else. I get lost in your eyes and find myself. You are my heartbeat, a part of my every breath, and the most beautiful gift in my life.

I want to write a new story with you every day, one that is filled with love and happiness. Seeing you happy, fulfilling your dreams, and watching our love story unfold brings me the greatest joy. You are my girlfriend and you are incredibly special to me.</p1>
    <p class="signature">With all my love,<br>Adyan</p>
